                <h2><a href="https://cloud.anwespanda.com/">Nextcloud</a></h2>
                <p>Nextcloud is an open source alternative to services like Google Drive or Office 365. I have been running a self hosted instance of Nextcloud for a few years, and it serves as my primary cloud server.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://uptime.anwespanda.com/">Uptime</a></h2>
                <p>Uptime-kuma is an uptime monitoring tool that I have recently started using. It can show you statistics about how long your website has been running without any downtime, and can immediately notify you via Telegram in case anything goes wrong. </p>

                <h2><a href="https://lock.anwespanda.com/">Bitwarden</a></h2>
                <p>Bitwarden is a personal password manager that I had been using primarily for the last few years. Recently however I've made the shift towards KeePass as that suits my needs a little better and lets me sleep more peacefully at night knowing that my passwords are stored entirely offline in an encrypted database. Feel free to use my Bitwarden instance as it is open to the public.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://notes.anwespanda.com/">Trilium</a></h2>
                <p>Trilium is a new addition to my stack, but one that has become undoubtedly one of my favorites. Built by zadam from Github, it is a brilliant way of organizing your notes in a hierarchical manner. I use it every single day as my workout journal. Sadly it does not support users yet and thus is not open for public access. </p>
